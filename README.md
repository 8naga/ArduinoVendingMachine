This is the Arduino code to be used with an old vending machine which had a faulty controller board.

The code is used with an Arduino Pro Mini.

It communicates with a Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth. The Raspberry Pi is running a Python script: <https://github.com/Jervelund/VendingMachinePython> allowing it to tweet different status messages. The current status of the machine can be seen at it's Twitter profile: <https://twitter.com/43vending>.
